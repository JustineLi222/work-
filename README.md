The model that TensorFlow creates is like a set of instructions for the computer that tell it what to look for and how to do things. Once the model is created, we can use it to make the computer do things like recognize pictures or translate languages.

<h2>2.Signal to noise ratio</h2>

2.1Power Signal to noise ratio


<p>equation:avg signal power/avg noise power</p>
2.2Voltage
<p>rms signal voltage/rms noise voltage</p>
<p>rms: root mean squared</p>
<p>SNR power=(SNR voltage)^2</p>
<p>express in terms of Db</p>
<b>10log(SNR power) for power</b><br>
<b>20log(SNR voltage) for voltage</b>
